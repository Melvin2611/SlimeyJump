This software is still in Production, and hasn't been tested on many devices, so Crashes might happen.

### About:
This is my first Game and made in Godot 4.4.1 and then updated to Godot 4.5 If you have Feedback or Ideas for new Levels feel free to contact me and share, if you do enough help you might even get a Special Thanks in the Credits.

#### I'am using some Assets from Itch.io the creators of these Assets are:
- Ansimuz
- iPixl
- Raou
- BDragon1727
Please check out their pages, as they are great and talented Pixel artists.
all other sprites are made by myself

The Code has been writen by myself, but some bug fixing and correcting and optimization has been done with AI. I did although go over the entire code everytime it has been writen by AI and validated it to understand what it has done and how it's doing it, and also to make sure, that nothing breaks when I run the code.
