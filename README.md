### Godot 4.5 Game

### IMPORTANT
- The game currently is still in an unfinished state, if for some reason it crashes I will not take responsibility for any damaged caused by this!
- The game has only been thouroughly tested on Android 15, so if there are versions specific Bugs you notice, please do not refrain from telling me the version and recreation details, so I can fix it.

#### about
This game is a Puzzle Platformer for android and Windows devices
if you notice any problems please don't hesitate to contact me and I will try to answer as soon as possible!
Feedback and new Ideas are also appreciated, I created this project as means to test and improve my Skill and also see how much I can get into creative and sometimes Frustrating Tasks.

To see what has changed over the Versions please see the Patchlogs.md (In English on Top and German at the Bottom)

The game is currently just in German, but I plan to make a Language option in the Settings.

For the Time being every Level is available from the Start, but this will also change in the Future, with planned Level skips you'll be able to buy with coins.
